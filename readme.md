# simple-prose

By Brandon Jackson

This project's goal is to make it easier for writers to write 
simple sentences. It accomplishes this by measuring whether the
words in a text are commonly used as a heuristic measurement
of reading level.

### Stop Writing Difficult Prose.
If you are like most writers you probably are prone to write long and verbose sentence constructions like this one, which are not easy for your readers to understand. It is more difficult for their brain to process sentences when they are long (and when they use lots of complicated words). In fact, research has shown that you can predict the reading level of a text just by looking at how long sentences are and counting how many complicated words there are.

### Start Writing Clearly.
Easy-Reader helps you write clearly. It performs readability analysis on your text. It shows you how its readability changes from sentence to sentence. Use the analysis to help you rewrite problematic sections.

{"name":"Easy-Reader","tagline":"Readability Analysis Made Simple","body":"### Stop Writing Difficult Prose.\r\nIf you are like most writers you probably are prone to write long and verbose sentence constructions like this one, which are not easy for your readers to understand. It is more difficult for their brain to process sentences when they are long (and when they use lots of complicated words). In fact, research has shown that you can predict the reading level of a text just by looking at how long sentences are and counting how many complicated words there are.\r\n\r\n### Start Writing Clearly.\r\nEasy-Reader helps you write clearly. It performs readability analysis on your text. It shows you how its readability changes from sentence to sentence. Use the analysis to help you rewrite problematic sections.\r\n\r\n### Features.\r\n- Readability Graph\r\n- Sentence-by-Sentence SMOG Readability Analysis\r\n- ngrams Word Analysis\r\n- Simple English Word Analysis\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
